## About.





## Documentation.





## Behavior Driven Development.
* Very similar to TDD.
* Describes the expected behavior of software.
  * Often expressed as: when/then; given/when/then.
* Commonly abbreviated as BDD.
* BDD started in 2004 by Dan North.
* Dan North has said BDD was established to help people learn TDD.
* BDD is largely a different way of looking at testing.
* BDD focuses on behavior vs “tests”.
* “Unit Tests” are referred to as specification - ie specifications of behaviors.
* Test method names should be sentences -ie saveValidID.





## Given When Then.
* BDD Tests are often written in a given-when-then context.
* This approach often helps you organize your thoughts when writing the test.
* Given - Setup of the text.
* When - Action of the test - ie when method is called.
* Then - Verification of expected results.





## Mockito and BDD.
* Mockito has added BDD Support in class BDDMockito.
* static method given allows you to configure mocks.
* static method then allows you to verify mock interactions.
